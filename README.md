# VisitNow

VisitNow is an app created for travellers that wwant to know the world. Using the app, people can search information about different countries and choose where to travel or migrate.
One of the key features of VisitNow is that the app gets all the information about countries' restrictions together in a single place. Using the app, the traveller doesn't need to spend days researching in different webpages, as everyting is put together in his phone.
The user can tell the app where he is from, what languages he speaks and how old is he, and using this information, the app will suggest the best places to visit or migrate.

This project was developed using:
- Android Studio (Java) for the Android app.
- MS SQL for the database.
